# Major-Project-
A Project on how the Lane line detection system in Self Driving cars work

Lane Line Detection System

This project addresses the critical issue of road safety by implementing a Lane Detection System using computer vision techniques with Python and OpenCV.  The system aims to mitigate accidents caused by driver inattention and reckless driving, thereby enhancing the safety of both drivers and pedestrians.    

Key Features and Technology

The system processes video streams from a front-facing camera to identify lane boundaries in real-time.    

It enhances accuracy and simplicity by using video input instead of static images, converting videos into frames for analysis.    

The core technology used includes Python and OpenCV, leveraging computer vision algorithms to detect lane markings, and providing functionalities such as road line position indication and lane change recognition.    

The system is designed to be cost-effective by utilizing open-source tools and adaptable to various driving environments and lighting conditions.    

It is also capable of curve detection.    

Comparison to Existing Systems

The proposed video-based system improves upon existing image-based systems that use the SVM algorithm, which are often challenged by low accuracy, complexity, and difficulty in consistently detecting lane markings.  This system offers enhanced accuracy, simplicity, and efficiency, contributing to overall road safety and the development of autonomous vehicle technologies.
